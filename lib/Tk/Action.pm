=head1 NAME

Tk::Action - action abstraction for tk

=head1 VERSION

version 1.093380

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $action = Tk::Action->new(
        window   => $mw,
        callback => \&jfdi,
    );
    $action->add_widget( $menu_entry );
    $action->add_widget( $button );
    $action->add_binding( '<Control-F>' );
    $action->enable;
    ...
    $action->disable;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Menu entries are often also available in toolbars or other widgets. And
sometimes, we want to enable or disable a given action, and this means
having to update everywhere this action is allowed.

This module helps managing actions in a L<Tk> GUI: just create a new
object, associate some widgets and bindings with C<add_widget()> and
then de/activate the whole action at once with C<enable()> or
C<disable()>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 callback

The callback associated to the action. It is needed to create the
shortcut bindings. Required, no default.

=head2 window

The window holding the widgets being part of the action object. It is
needed to create the shortcut bindings. Required, no default.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $action->add_widget( $widget );

Associate C<$widget> with C<$action>. Enable or disable it depending on
current action status.

=head2 $action->rm_widget( $widget );

De-associate C<$widget> from C$<action>.

=head2 $action->add_binding( $binding );

Associate C<$binding> with C<$action>. Enable or disable it depending on
current action status. C<$binding> is a regular binding, as defined by
L<Tk::bind>.

It is not possible to remove a binding from an action.

=head2 $action->enable;

Activate all associated widgets and shortcuts.

=head2 $action->disable;

De-activate all associated widgets and shortcuts.
